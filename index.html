    <h2> What motivated me to start coding?</h2>
    <p> Ironically, my passion for law has motivated me to learn to code and become a web developper. I am a second-year law student at University College London in the United Kingdom. Whilst pursuing my degree I have attended various talks, and conferences
      regarding thelegal sector and the words that have pervaded almost every conference are:<em> AI </em> and <em> tech </em>. At first, I was taken aback by the fact that a room full of lawyers are more interested in technology than debating the merits
      of the most recent Supreme Court decision. However, lawyers are afraid that AI and tech will take our jobs, and a new report from Burning Glass, a job market analytics firm, found that there were as many as 7 million job openings in 2015 in occupations
      that required coding skills. This has shown me that no career is immune to the invasion of tech, I believe that learning code will make my job prospects better . However, I also believe that learning to code will open my mind to a new way of thinking
      and it will teach me numerous transferable skills during my long summer break. Lastly, I have co-founded a small startup with my friends called Think256 and at our first event we challenged our attendees to step out of our comfort zones, learning
      to code will push me out of the world of legal documents into computers and I am excited!</p>
